# Hatch Front End Demo

To get going:

- Clone this repo
- `cd front-end-demo`
- `npm install`
- get a snack
- `npm start`
- hooray!

## Acceptance Criteria

- The user will click the on-screen button to load data.
- While loading data, a loading indicator is displayed, replacing the no data message.
- After the data loads, the loading indicator is removed, and we display a list of buildings to the user. Under each bulding is a list of commodities that the building uses. The commodity names should be human-readable. An example is below, but you do not need to match the styling.
